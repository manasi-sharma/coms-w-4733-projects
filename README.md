## COMS W 4733 Homework Projects

These are the homework projects I worked on for the COMS W 4733: Computational Aspects of Robotics course at Columbia University (https://sites.google.com/view/coms4733-fall2020/home?authuser=0) in Fall '20. I completed:
1)	**Project 1**: training a neural network to perform image segmentation using RGB images and corresponding ground truth instance segmentation masks obtained from a simulated camera 
2)	**Project 2**: manipulating a UR5 robot (https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) to perform grasping in simulation (using PyBullet physics simulation engine), using the R.R.T. path planning algorithm
3)	**Project 3**: using Imitation Learning to make a robot follow the white line in various paths (such as a circle, pentagon, triangle, etc.) by training a CNN using Transfer Learning (from ResNet 18); the dataset is assembled utilizing my own demonstration data that is collected by manually controlling the robot using keyboard
The video demonstrating the performance of my path planning implementation can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jY8FTK75hK7m0LNzau-4GWJyTNarrF6n/view?usp=sharing
